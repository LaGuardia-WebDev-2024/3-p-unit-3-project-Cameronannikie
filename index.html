<td>Creamy Garlic Pasta</td>
<td>2 teaspoons olive oil

4 garlic cloves, minced

2 tablespoons butter

3 cups chicken broth, or more as needed

½ teaspoon ground black pepper

¼ teaspoon salt

½ pound spaghetti

1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

¾ cup heavy cream

1 ½ tablespoons dried parsley</td>
<td>Gather all ingredients. Heat olive oil in a medium pan over medium heat. Add garlic and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add butter and stir constantly until melted. Pour in 3 cups chicken broth; add pepper and salt. Bring to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Add more chicken broth if pasta starts to stick to the pan. Add Parmesan cheese, cream, and parsley and mix until thoroughly combined. Serve immediately.</td>

<td>Chicken</td>
<td>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1.3 lbs. total)* ($6.49)
1/2 tsp Italian seasoning ($0.05)
1/2 tsp salt ($0.02)
1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper ($0.02)
1/4 cup all-purpose flour ($0.06)
2 Tbsp olive oil ($0.32)
2 Tbsp butter, divided ($0.27)
1 whole garlic bulb (about 8-9 garlic cloves)** ($0.64)
1 cup chicken broth ($0.17)
3/4 cup heavy cream ($1.08)
1/2 tsp garlic powder ($0.05)
Salt and Pepper to taste ($0.04) </td>
<td>Using a sharp knife, carefully fillet each chicken breast into two thinner cutlets (or use thin-cut chicken breasts).
Season each breast with Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Then sprinkle the flour over both sides of the chicken breasts and rub it in until the chicken is evenly coated.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil and 1 Tbsp of butter. Once the skillet is hot, add the chicken and cook on each side until golden brown and cooked through (about 4 minutes per side). Remove the cooked chicken to a clean plate and cover to keep warm.
While the chicken is cooking, peel the garlic cloves and then carefully smash them with the side of a large chef's knife by pressing down on the side of the knife with the heel of your hand.
Once the chicken is removed, to the same skillet add the remaining 1 Tbsp of butter, then add the garlic cloves. Turn the heat down to medium-low and sauté the garlic for 3 minutes or until lightly browned and fragrant. Make sure to stir the garlic frequently to prevent it from burning.Next pour the chicken broth and heavy cream into the skillet, then add the garlic powder. Stir and scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Allow the sauce to simmer in the skillet for 8-10 minutes, or until it has reduced and thickened by about 50%. Taste the sauce at this point and add salt and pepper if needed (I added about ⅛ tsp of salt and ⅛ tsp of black pepper). Finally, return the cooked chicken breasts to the skillet and spoon the creamy sauce over top. Allow the chicken to heat through. Serve with fresh chopped parsley (optional), and enjoy! </td>

<td>Burger</td>
<td>8 slices regular bacon (7 to 8 ounces)
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon ketchup
2 teaspoons sweet pickle relish
1/2 small head iceberg lettuce
1 large beefsteak or vine tomato (about 6 ounces)
4 hamburger buns
2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
1 pound ground chuck (80% lean) 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil, divided
4 slices cheddar or American cheese</td>
<td>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400ºF. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange 8 bacon slices in a single layer on the foil. Bake until browned and crisp, 19 to 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the toppings and cook the burger patties. Place 1/4 cup mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon ketchup, and 2 teaspoons sweet pickle relish in a small bowl and stir to combine.
Remove the leaves from 1/2 medium head iceberg lettuce until you have 8 burger-sized leaves. Using a serrated knife, slice 1 beefsteak tomato crosswise into 4 slices. Split 4 hamburger buns and spread 2 tablespoons yellow mustard on the cut sides of the top buns, evenly spreading it to the edges.
Divide 1 pound ground chuck into 4 portions, then form each portion into a ball. Press each ball into a patty about 1/2-inch wider than the hamburger buns. Sprinkle the patties all over with 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper.
Heat 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet (at least 12 inches wide) or griddle over medium-high heat until shimmering. (If using a smaller skillet, cook the buns and burgers in 2 batches.) Tilt the pan so the oil coats the bottom. Place the mustard buns in the pan mustard-side down, gently press down on them, and cook until toasty and browned in spots, 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
Place the bottom buns cut-side down in the pan and cook until golden brown and toasted, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer to the plate with the mustard buns. Reserve the pan.
When the bacon is ready, transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and cut or tear in half crosswise.
Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in the pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Tilt the pan to coat the bottom with oil. Add the burger patties (cook in 2 batches if needed) and press on each patty with the back of a flat spatula. Cook until the bottoms are deeply browned and the patty is halfway cooked, about 2 1/2 minutes. Flip the burgers and place 1 slice of cheese on each patty. Cook for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes more, depending on desired burger doneness.
Transfer to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, spread the mayonnaise mixture on the cut sides of the bottom buns, spreading to the edges.
Assemble the burgers: Place a patty on each bottom bun. Top each patty with 4 bacon pieces, 1 tomato slice, 2 lettuce leaves, and the top bun.</td>
